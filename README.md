IPSEN2 Java Backend Project
=============================

### Case 
This project was a required assignment for my second year Software Engineering Bachelors degree.

The case was to make a CRUD backend for uploading student projects. It was required to use Dropwizard, a Java backend framework.

For project reasons we used the waterfall method for developing this software, to understand why it's not used anymore in software development anymore.

A java backend for this case is total overkill in my opinion, there are far more better solutions to solve this case.
